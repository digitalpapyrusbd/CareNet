## 🛡️ Moderator as First Line of Response

### **Disputes**
**Workflow:**

- Admin handles all escalated disputes directly

### **Support Tickets**
**Workflow:**
- Moderator receives all incoming tickets (first line)
- Reviews ticket details
- **Decision:**
  - **Can resolve** → Moderator resolves → Submits to Admin for approval

## 💼 Package Negotiation & Job System

### **Guardian/Patient → Agency Negotiation**
1. Guardian browses agencies and packages
2. Guardian can **send counter-offer** (price discount or customization)
3. Agency responds with:
   - Discount offer
   - Package additions/customization
   - Decline
4. Guardian accepts/counter-offers again/browses others
5. **Purchase → Package becomes JOB**

### **Agency Job Deployment**
1. Purchased package appears in Agency Job Inbox
2. Agency assigns caregiver:
   - From agency roster (existing employees)
   - From platform caregiver pool (search & recruit)
3. Agency deploys caregiver (sends job offer)
4. Caregiver accepts or declines
5. If accepted → Job Active
6. If declined → Agency assigns different caregiver

### **Caregiver Job Acceptance**
1. Caregiver receives job offer
2. Views job details (NO pricing shown to caregiver)
3. Accepts or declines
4. If accepted → On assignment

## 🔍 Agency Caregiver Pool Access

1. **Search Caregiver Pool** - Browse all platform caregivers
2. **Apply Filters** - Skills, location, availability, ratings
3. **View Results** - Matching caregivers

## 🔑 Key Principles

1. **Admin has supreme authority** - Nothing is final without Admin approval
2. **Moderators are first line** - They handle initial review/triage
3. **Quality control** - Admin can send work back for improvement
4. **Escalation path** - Complex issues go straight to Admin
5. **No autonomous moderator approvals** - Everything requires Admin sign-off
6. **Package → Job conversion** - Purchases automatically become jobs
7. **Agency controls deployment** - Agency chooses which caregiver for job
8. **Caregiver autonomy** - Caregivers can decline jobs
