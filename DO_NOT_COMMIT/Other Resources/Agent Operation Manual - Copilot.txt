Agent Operation Manual
Project: Caregiver Digital Solution Version: 1.0 Owner: AI Coding Agent Status: Active

1. Mission & Scope
The AI Coding Agent is tasked with autonomously building and maintaining the Caregiver Digital Solution. It must:

Parse and apply requirements from uploaded resource files.

Execute tasks in line with PRD, Technical Architecture, Data Models, UX Flows, File Architecture, and Compliance.

Maintain a dynamic checklist of progress.

Document issues, assumptions, and commentary.

Deliver a compliant, production-ready codebase without human intervention.

2. Resource Files & Usage
File	Purpose	Agent Action
01 PRD_CaregiverSolution.md	Defines features, user roles, workflows, roadmap	Extract features, prioritize MVP tasks
02 Technical_Architecture.md	Tech stack, APIs, CI/CD, monitoring	Generate frontend/backend modules, infra scripts
03 Data_Model.md	PostgreSQL schema, constraints, triggers	Create migrations, ORM models, enforce rules
04 UX_Flow_&_Screens.md	User journeys, accessibility, design system	Build UI components, navigation, accessibility
05 File_Architecture.md	Folder structures for web, mobile, backend	Place code in correct directories
06 Compliance_&_Metrics.md	Legal compliance, KPIs	Validate encryption, retention, metrics tracking
3. Instruction Handling
Conditional Instructions

Respect PRD roadmap phases (MVP → Growth → Intelligence).

Apply environment-specific rules (Dev, Staging, Production).

Enforce compliance constraints (HIPAA/GDPR-style retention, encryption).

Priority Rules

MVP features (auth, dashboards, payments, caregiver clock-in/out) come first.

Compliance and safety tasks override feature development.

4. Checklist Management
The agent maintains a JSON checklist file:

json
[
  {
    "task": "Guardian registration & authentication",
    "status": "Completed",
    "comments": "JWT + MFA implemented per Technical Architecture"
  },
  {
    "task": "Caregiver mobile check-in/out",
    "status": "Pending",
    "comments": "Awaiting GPS + photo verification module"
  },
  {
    "task": "Company dashboard package builder",
    "status": "In Progress",
    "comments": "UI scaffolded, backend API integration pending"
  }
]
Statuses: Pending, In Progress, Completed

Updates: Auto-updated after each execution

Timestamps: Each update logged

5. Task Commentary
For each task, the agent must add:

Progress Notes: “Next.js Guardian dashboard scaffolded.”

Issues/Warnings: “Payment gateway sandbox API not responding.”

Suggestions: “Consider caching caregiver search results in Redis.”

6. Autonomy Rules
No Human Intervention: Agent relies solely on uploaded files + checklist.

Error Handling: Log errors in error_log.md. Continue unless compliance violation occurs.

Assumptions: Document assumptions if ambiguity arises (e.g., missing UX detail).

7. Output & Deliverables
Codebase following /caregiver-web, /caregiver-app, /api structures.

Updated checklist with statuses and comments.

Compliance report validating encryption, retention, and jurisdiction rules.

Documentation auto-generated from PRD, architecture, and data models.

8. Example Workflow
Parse PRD → Extract MVP features (auth, dashboards, payments).

Cross-reference Technical Architecture → Identify NestJS modules, Next.js pages, React Native screens.

Apply Data Models → Generate PostgreSQL migrations + ORM schemas.

Implement UX Flows → Build Guardian, Company, Caregiver, Moderator interfaces.

Follow File Architecture → Place code in correct directories.

Validate against Compliance & Metrics → Encryption, NPS tracking, dispute resolution.

Update Checklist → Mark tasks done/pending.

Add Commentary → Document issues, assumptions, and progress.

9. Compliance & Metrics Tracking
Legal Compliance: Data jurisdiction, encryption, retention.

Operational Metrics: Adoption, engagement, trust, satisfaction, revenue, dispute resolution.

Reporting: Agent generates compliance logs and KPI dashboards.

10. Logs & Files
Checklist File: checklist.json

Error Log: error_log.md

Compliance Report: compliance_report.md

Agent Commentary: Inline within checklist + separate commentary.md

11. Governance
Versioning: Each update tagged with version + timestamp.

Audit Trail: All changes logged in audit_logs per Data Model.

Deprecation Policy: Old APIs maintained for 6 months before sunset.
